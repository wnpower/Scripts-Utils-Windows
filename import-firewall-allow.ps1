#.Parameter ProfileType
#    (Optional) Comma-delimited list of network profile types for which the
#    blocking rules will apply: public, private, domain, any (default = any).
#
#.Parameter InterfaceType
#    (Optional) Comma-delimited list of interface types for which the
#    blocking rules will apply: wireless, ras, lan, any (default = any).
#
#.Parameter DeleteOnly
#    (Switch) Matching firewall rules will be deleted, none will be created.
#    When used with -RuleName, leave off the "-#1" at the end of the rulename.
#

# Incidentally, testing shows a delay of 2-5 seconds sometimes for the initial
# connection when there are more than 5000 IP address ranges total in the various
# outbound rules (once established, there is no delay).  However, it does not seem
# consistent.  Also, at 5000+ subnets in one's rules, it delays the opening of the
# Windows Firewall snap-in, and at 9000+ subnets it sometimes prevents the WF snap-in
# from opening successfully at all.  However, this behavior is not consistent either.
